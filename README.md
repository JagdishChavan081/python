# Introduction To Programming with Python
Core, Advance and DSA with Python

Folder 1 Core Python

In This folder I'll review a number of concepts in the basic Python by building small programs that incorporate various Python constructs, 
main focus will be simulation of a bank, performing operations on one, two and multiple accounts, using procedural programming-that is using
the standard techniques of data and functions.

Folder 2: Advance Python

I'll rewrite these programs using OOP techniques, and explain key problems inherent in procedural programming.
with that understanding, the folder that follow will explain how OOP solves those problems

Folder 3: DSA with Python

So far so learnt and practiced with Procedural and Object oriented approach using both first 
here focus will be on solving DSA coding challenges  and bring solution to table.
